# Binary-to-Gray-code-converter
The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how Binary to Gray Code Converters operate, focusing on the step-by-step conversion process and the underlying digital logic. 
Through this project, we aim to gain insights into the design process, the behavior of combinational circuits, and the significance of Gray code in minimizing errors during data transmission and digital communication systems.
